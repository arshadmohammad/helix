Release Notes for Apache Helix 2.0.0

  The Apache Helix team would like to announce the release of Apache Helix 2.0.0.

  This is the thirty third release under the Apache umbrella, and the twenty ninth as a top-level project.

  Helix is a generic cluster management framework used for the automatic management of partitioned, replicated and distributed resources hosted on a cluster of nodes.

[]

* Major Feature

  ** Helix Gateway

  Introduced the helix-gateway module, a standalone sidecar service that enables non-JVM applications to participate in Helix-managed clusters. Helix Gateway manages ZooKeeper connections and participant lifecycle on behalf of remote application instances, communicating via bidirectional streaming gRPC or file-based polling. This eliminates the requirement for applications to embed the Helix Java client library and opens Helix to polyglot environments (Python, Go, C++, etc.). Key capabilities include:

    * Bidirectional streaming gRPC service for real-time state transition forwarding and response handling

    * File-based poll mode for sidecar deployments using shared volumes (e.g., Kubernetes pods)

    * In-memory current state and target state caching per cluster/instance/resource/shard

    * Support for multiple clusters and multiple participants in a single gateway instance

    * Generic multi-top-state state model with wildcard transition handling

  ** Sunset Helix UI Modules (helix-front and helix-admin-webapp)

  Removed the helix-front and helix-admin-webapp modules from the Helix distribution for security reasons. These web UI components carried third-party frontend dependencies with known vulnerabilities and were not actively maintained. Users who require a management UI are encouraged to use the Helix REST Service 2.0 API directly or build custom tooling on top of it.
